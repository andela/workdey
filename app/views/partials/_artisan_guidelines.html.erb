        <p class="left-align">
          The following section detail how you should conduct your business on the workdey platform.
        </p>

        <h3 class="left-align">
          <strong>Accepting Tasks</strong>
        </h3>

        <ul class="guidelines left-align">
          <li>
            Update your account with relevant information about tasks that you are qualified to handle and you are willing to do. You are expected to accept tasks that fall within the boundaries set by you.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="left-align">
          <strong>Rejecting Tasks</strong>
        </h3>

        <ul class="guidelines left-align">
          <li>
            Reject tasks if you feel that you cannot deliver the very best.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reject tasks if you feel unsafe about carrying out the task or the location.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reject tasks if you won't be able to carry it out in the specified time period.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="left-align">
          <strong>Bidding for tasks</strong>
        </h3>

        <ul class="guidelines left-align">
          <li>
            A client will not always choose one particular artisan to carry out a task, this is true especially when the client hasn't worked with any artisan before and in this situation, your reputation on the platform will go a long way in helping you seal the deal.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can't negotiate for this kind of task as the price will more than likely be fixed at a certain price.
          </li>
          <li>
            Only bid for tasks you are able to carry out effectively and efficiently.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="left-align">
          <strong>Negotiations and rates</strong>
        </h3>

        <ul class="guidelines left-align">
          <li>
            You can set your price range for different task types that you are able to carry out. This will go a long way when clients are looking for a artisan to delegate a task to. Once a task is accepted, you can't review the price until the task is done.
          </li>
          <li>
            Always review your price range to make sure it is commensurate with your skill level, qualifications, experience and availability.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once a task is complete, endeavor to mark it as complete.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="left-align">
          <strong>Out-of-pocket expenses</strong>
        </h3>

        <ul class="guidelines left-align">
          <li>
            Make sure to be reimbursed for any purchase made on behalf or at the behest of a client.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not ask for transportation reimbursement from the client. Make sure to take this into consideration before accepting a task and set your price range appropriately.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="left-align">
          <strong>Safety</strong>
        </h3>

        <ul class="guidelines left-align">
          <li>
            You should make safety a top priority, politely leave the task if you feel uncomfortable or unsafe about carrying out a task.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not accept any task that puts you at financial risk or risk of physical injury.
          </li>
        </ul>
